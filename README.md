# CIS243FinalProject
Sweet-shop
This website was created by Natalia Grechukhina to show what knowledge of CIS 243 Web III Intro to PHP class was gained during this Winter Quarter 2021.

This website created in CMS system WordPress.

The site was created for a cake-shop Gracey, which is sell cakes, cupcakes, and other sweets. This company does not exist, and this website was created only for my Final Project.

My site has a Twenty Twenty theme installed, but the site has been completely redesigned.

For the website design, I used the Elementor plugin, which allows to create blocks and buttons for the websites. I only used the free content of this plugin, so the functionality of the site is not very extensive.

I have installed the Call back plugin, which is floating in right lower corner of website and will allows customers call to the store.

You can see the Social Media and Share Icons plugin that allows the client to share the website on social media.

I created template of website to determine which blocks I would create, then I thought over the design of the site and then proceeded to create a site on Wordpress.

The first block of the site is the name of the store and the button that will lead the client to the contact section.

The second block of the site informs the client about the store.

The third block of the site is a gallery of the last orders of the store.

Next, you can see a block listing the company's field of work in the form of icons.

The next block is customer reviews.

The last of the main blocks is the section of contacts and icons of interaction with social networks.

At the end of the web site there is a small footer with information about the author of the website.
